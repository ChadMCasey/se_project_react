i will fill in this template, i just wanted to get my project submitted so the review process could be underway.

Also if you are reading this and you are a code reviewer, i wasnt able to get form validation to work. I need the js script "formValidator.js" and "index.js" to run after the dom has created the form elements for the form validation to apply to the forms. I think i need to defer those scripts in some way. Please leave some comments to help me out regarding this.
